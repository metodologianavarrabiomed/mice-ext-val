# MiceExtVal

This package allows the user to externally validate Cox and Logistic
Regression models from the data that are usually reported in the
articles. The package is formed by functions that allow the user to
recalibrate the models and also obtain the discrimination and
calibration performance while working with multiple imputed data.
