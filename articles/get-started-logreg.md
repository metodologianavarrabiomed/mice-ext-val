# Example Of Use With Dichotomous Outcome

##### Required Libraries

The following code snippet lists all the libraries needed to run this
report.

``` r
library(MiceExtVal)
library(gtsummary)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
```

The `MiceExtVal` package is designed to facilitate the external
validation of prediction models, particularly in clinical research
settings. In this vignette, we illustrate its use by replicating a
well-known example from Steyerberg ([2019](#ref-steyerberg)), presented
in Chapter 20 of his book. Specifically, we demonstrate how to
externally validate the TIMI-II model, originally developed by Mueller
et al. ([1992](#ref-timi-ii)), using data from the Western region cohort
of the GUSTO-I trial. This dataset is included in the package as
[`MiceExtVal::gusto`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/gusto.md).

The TIMI-II model is a logistic regression model that predicts 42-day
mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Our aim is to
assess the model’s performance in a new population—patients in the
GUSTO-I Western region cohort, which provides only 30 days of follow-up.
Through this example, users will learn how the MiceExtVal package
supports the evaluation of model transportability and predictive
accuracy across different clinical settings.

| Predictor      | Coefficient |
|:---------------|------------:|
| Shock          |        1.79 |
| Age \> 65      |        0.99 |
| High risk      |        0.92 |
| Diabetes       |        0.74 |
| Hypotension    |        0.69 |
| Tachycardia    |        0.59 |
| Time to relief |        0.53 |
| Sex            |        0.47 |
| Intercept      |       -4.47 |

## Explore the dataset

The first step in any data analysis or validation project is to become
familiar with the dataset. The MiceExtVal package includes the GUSTO-I
Western region dataset, which is also used in the example from
Steyerberg ([2019](#ref-steyerberg)). To illustrate the use of multiple
imputation — a key requirement of the package — we provide a modified
version of the dataset with artificially introduced missing values. This
setup allows users to work through a realistic example where incomplete
data must be addressed.

[Table 2](#tbl-gusto-sum) presents a descriptive summary of the dataset.
Notably, the cohort includes nearly three times as many men as women.
While most variables appear similar across sexes, there is a marked
difference in mortality rates: \\11\\\\ in women compared to \\4.7\\\\
in men. This disparity may be partially explained by age, as \\57\\\\ of
the female patients are over \\65\\ years old, compared to only \\32\\\\
of the male patients. As previously mentioned, missing values are
distributed across most variables in a similar pattern, and will need to
be handled appropriately during the validation process.

``` r
gusto <- MiceExtVal::gusto |> dplyr::mutate(id = dplyr::row_number())

gusto |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    sex = dplyr::case_when(
      sex == 0 ~ "Male", sex == 1 ~ "Female",
      .default = as.character(sex)
    )
  ) |>
  dplyr::select(-id) |>
  gtsummary::tbl_summary(
    by = "sex",
    missing_text = "% of missings",
    missing_stat = "{p_miss}%"
  )
```

## Handling Missing Data

Although the main objective of this vignette is to demonstrate the use
of the MiceExtVal package for external model validation, addressing
missing data is a necessary step—and one that reflects best practices in
clinical research. Multiple imputation is widely recommended as a
statistically sound method for handling missing values, as it preserves
power and reduces bias compared to simpler approaches like complete case
analysis, Buuren ([2018](#ref-vanBuuren2018)).

The `MiceExtVal` package is built to integrate seamlessly with workflows
that use multiple imputation. In fact, all of its core functions expect
the input data to be provided in long format, as produced by the `mice`
package van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn ([2011](#ref-mice-package)).

Below, we present a basic example using `mice` to perform multiple
imputation. We first construct a predictor matrix, excluding the `id`
variable, and then extract the imputed datasets in long format.

``` r
pred_matrix <- mice::make.predictorMatrix(gusto)
pred_matrix[, "id"] <- 0
gusto_imp <- mice::mice(gusto, predictorMatrix = pred_matrix, seed = 123) |>
  mice::complete("long")
```

The resulting object, `gusto_imp`, contains the multiply imputed
datasets stacked in long format. This structure is required for proper
functioning of the `MiceExtVal` package.

For a more comprehensive discussion on multiple imputation methodology
and its practical application, we refer readers to Flexible Imputation
of Missing Data by Buuren ([2018](#ref-vanBuuren2018)), and to the
original mice package paper by van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn
([2011](#ref-mice-package)).

## External Validation

Traditional external validation is typically performed on a single,
complete dataset and involves several sequential steps. First, the
original model is used to generate predictions for the new dataset.
Then, the model’s performance is evaluated by assessing its
discrimination (e.g., AUC) and calibration. If necessary, the model may
be recalibrated, and performance metrics re-evaluated after adjustment.

However, when working with datasets containing missing values—especially
in clinical research—multiple imputation is often used to preserve data
integrity and avoid bias. As a result, we no longer have a single
dataset, but multiple imputed versions of the original data, each
representing a plausible completion. This complicates traditional
validation workflows, since each imputed dataset yields different
results that must be pooled appropriately.

The `MiceExtVal` package is designed to bridge this gap by streamlining
the external validation process across multiple imputed datasets. It
allows users to perform all validation steps—including prediction,
performance evaluation, and optional recalibration while properly
handling the variability introduced by imputation.

Having completed the imputation in the previous section, we are now
ready to externally validate the TIMI-II model using `MiceExtVal`. Since
TIMI-II is a logistic regression model, we begin by defining it with the
[`MiceExtVal::mv_model_logreg()`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/mv_model_logreg.md)
function. This function requires a formula specifying the model’s
coefficients and intercept. It is essential that all variables included
in the formula are present in the imputed dataset; otherwise, subsequent
functions will raise an error.

``` r
timi2_model <- MiceExtVal::mv_model_logreg(
  formula = day30 ~ 1.79 * sho + 0.99 * a65 + 0.92 * hig + 0.74 * dia +
    0.69 * hyp + 0.59 * hrt + 0.53 * ttr + 0.47 * sex - 4.47
)
```

Once the model is defined using
[`MiceExtVal::mv_model_logreg()`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/mv_model_logreg.md),
the resulting object—stored in timi2_model—contains both the model
formula and the structural skeleton needed for subsequent steps. Most
functions in the `MiceExtVal` package take this model object as input
and return an updated version with additional components, such as
predictions or performance metrics. These functions follow a consistent
naming convention: those that modify the model object begin with the
prefix calculate\_.

The first step in the external validation process is to compute the
model’s original predictions on the external dataset. To do this, the
package provides the
[`MiceExtVal::calculate_predictions()`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/calculate_predictions.md)
function. This function requires two arguments: the model object (e.g.,
`timi2_model`) and the imputed dataset in long format (e.g.,
`gusto_imp`). It returns the same model object with the predicted
probabilities added, ready for subsequent validation steps.

``` r
timi2_model <- timi2_model |>
  MiceExtVal::calculate_predictions(gusto_imp)
```

After executing
[`MiceExtVal::calculate_predictions()`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/calculate_predictions.md),
the model object is updated with additional information derived from the
imputed dataset. Specifically, the predicted probabilities are computed
for each imputation and stored within the model. In addition, the
function calculates aggregated predictions for each patient by pooling
results across imputations. An example of these values are shown in
[Table 3](#tbl-model-predictions-example).

Beyond the predicted probabilities, the model object also includes the
linear predictors (\\\beta \cdot X\\), both at the individual imputation
level and as pooled estimates. These represent the raw score from the
logistic regression model before applying the inverse logit
transformation. [Table 4](#tbl-model-betax-example) presents these
values.

This structure—where all relevant prediction outputs are integrated into
the model object—allows for a streamlined workflow in which subsequent
steps like performance evaluation or recalibration can be carried out
with minimal additional input.

### Performance Assessment

Once the model predictions have been calculated, we can proceed to
assess the model’s performance on the external cohort. The first aspect
of performance we evaluate is discrimination, which reflects the model’s
ability to distinguish between patients who experienced the event and
those who did not.

The `MiceExtVal` package provides two functions to assess
discrimination:
[`MiceExtVal::calculate_auc()`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/calculate_auc.md)
and
[`MiceExtVal::calculate_harrell_c_index()`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/calculate_harrell_c_index.md).
The former computes the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic
Curve (AUC), which is appropriate for binary outcomes. The latter
calculates Harrell’s C-index, which is typically used for survival data.

Since our outcome is binary (death within 30 days), we will use AUC as
our measure of discrimination in this example.

``` r
timi2_model <- timi2_model |>
  MiceExtVal::calculate_auc(gusto_imp)

auc_res <- sprintf(
  "%.3f (95%% CI %.3f, %.3f)",
  timi2_model$auc["Estimate"],
  timi2_model$auc["95% CI L"],
  timi2_model$auc["95% CI U"]
)
```

The model yields an AUC of 0.797 (95% CI 0.775, 0.819), which indicates
a fairly good level of discrimination. As a second key component of
model performance, we now assess calibration, which evaluates how
closely the predicted probabilities agree with the observed outcomes.

Calibration is most commonly visualized using a calibration plot. In the
`MiceExtVal` package, generating this plot is a two-step process: first,
the calibration data must be computed; then, the plot itself can be
created.

To compute the calibration data, the package provides two functions:

- [`MiceExtVal::get_calibration_plot_data_prop()`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/get_calibration_plot_data_prop.md)
  estimates the observed risks using outcome proportions.
- [`MiceExtVal::get_calibration_plot_data_surv()`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/get_calibration_plot_data_surv.md)
  estimates observed risks using a Kaplan–Meier approach (for survival
  outcomes).

Since we are validating a logistic regression model with a binary
outcome, we use
[`MiceExtVal::get_calibration_plot_data_prop()`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/get_calibration_plot_data_prop.md).

In the code snippet below, we generate a calibration plot for the
TIMI-II model. We use
[`MiceExtVal::get_calibration_plot_data_prop()`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/get_calibration_plot_data_prop.md)
to compute the calibration data, followed by
[`MiceExtVal::get_calibration_plot()`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/get_calibration_plot.md)
to create the plot itself. The plot is generated using the `ggplot2`
package, allowing for full customization. In this example, we also apply
a custom function, `clip_axis_plot()`, to adjust the plot limits.

``` r
clip_axis_plot <- function(plot, limit = 1) {
  plot +
    ggplot2::xlim(c(0, limit)) +
    ggplot2::ylim(c(0, limit))
}

timi2_model |>
  MiceExtVal::get_calibration_plot_data_prop(
    data = gusto_imp,
    n_groups = 10,
    type = "predictions_aggregated"
  ) |>
  MiceExtVal::get_calibration_plot() |>
  clip_axis_plot(limit = 0.35)
```

![](get-started-logreg_files/figure-html/fig-timi2-calplot-1.png)

Figure 1: Calibration plot of TIMI-II predictions

In Figure [Figure 1](#fig-timi2-calplot), we observe a well-calibrated
model: the predicted risks align closely with the observed outcomes
across most deciles of risk. In practice, this level of agreement may be
considered sufficient, and no further recalibration would be necessary.

Another way of measuring the accuracy of the predictions of the model to
the observed risk is the Brier score. This score is calculated following

\\ BS = \frac{1}{N}\sum^N\_{t = 1}(f_t - o_t)^2 \\

where \\N\\ is the size of the population, \\f_t\\ is the model
prediction for the patient \\t\\ and \\o_t\\ is the observed risk for
the patient \\t\\ in this case \\0\\ if they suffer no event and \\1\\
otherwise. In the `MiceExtVal` package we have developed the function
[`MiceExtVal::calculate_brier_score`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/calculate_brier_score.md)
that help users to calculate the model brier score.

``` r
timi2_model <- timi2_model |>
  MiceExtVal::calculate_brier_score(
    data = gusto_imp, type = "predictions_aggregated", n_boot = 100
  )

brier_score_res <- sprintf(
  "%.3f (95%% CI %.3f, %.3f)",
  timi2_model$brier_score["Estimate"],
  timi2_model$brier_score["95% CI L"],
  timi2_model$brier_score["95% CI U"]
)
```

The model yields an AUC of 0.052 (95% CI 0.045, 0.059) that demonstrait
a fair accuracy between the model predictions and the observed risks.
However, to fully demonstrate the functionality of the `MiceExtVal`
package, we will proceed with recalibrating the model predictions. This
allows us to show how recalibration can be implemented when needed and
how it affects the model’s performance.

### Model Recalibration

The MiceExtVal package provides two distinct functions to perform
recalibration of model predictions:

- [`MiceExtVal::calculate_predictions_recalibrated_type_1()`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/calculate_predictions_recalibrated_type_1.md)
- [`MiceExtVal::calculate_predictions_recalibrated_type_2()`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/calculate_predictions_recalibrated_type_2.md)

These functions apply two different recalibration strategies.
Importantly, Type 1 and Type 2 recalibrations are independent
approaches. They are not sequential steps nor refinements of one
another, but alternative methods to adjust predicted risks based on the
external dataset.

After recalibration, we reassess model calibration using updated
calibration plots. However, we do not recalculate the AUC, since
recalibration modifies the predicted probabilities but does not affect
the model’s ability to rank individuals, and thus has no impact on
discrimination.

``` r
timi2_model <- timi2_model |>
  MiceExtVal::calculate_predictions_recalibrated_type_1(gusto_imp) |>
  MiceExtVal::calculate_predictions_recalibrated_type_2(gusto_imp)
```

In the previous code snippet, both types of recalibrated predictions
were computed simultaneously and stored within the model object. These
recalibrated predictions are provided as aggregated values, meaning that
each patient receives a single recalibrated risk estimate, pooled across
the multiple imputations. The resulting predictions can be seen in
[Table 5](#tbl-recal-example).

In addition to the recalibrated predictions, the corresponding
recalibration parameters—such as intercept and slope adjustments—are
also saved within the model object. This design ensures that all
relevant recalibration outputs are centralized and accessible for
further analysis or reporting.

``` r
timi2_model$predictions_recal_type_1 |>
  utils::head() |>
  kableExtra::kbl()
timi2_model$predictions_recal_type_2 |>
  utils::head() |>

```

|   4 |         0.0555939 |
|   5 |         0.0231448 |
|   6 |         0.0245219 |

\(b\) Type 2 recalibration

Table 5: Recalibrated predictions

The recalibration parameters obtained for this model are:

- Type 1 recalibration: \\\alpha\_{\text{type1}} = -0.366\\
- Type 2 recalibration: \\\alpha\_{\text{type2}} = -0.179,
  \beta\_{\text{overall}} = 1.096\\

These parameters are automatically stored in the model object after
recalibration. If you would like more details about how these
recalibrated predictions are computed, please refer to the documentation
for each function.

As mentioned earlier, recalibration does not affect model
discrimination. This is because all predictions are shifted or scaled
uniformly, preserving the model’s ability to rank individuals. However,
recalibration does affect model calibration, since the predictions are
explicitly adjusted to better reflect the observed outcome frequencies
in the external cohort.

To visualize the effect of recalibration, we generate calibration plots
using the same plotting functions introduced earlier. The only
difference is specifying the type of recalibrated predictions we wish to
plot. The following code snippet demonstrates how to generate
calibration plots for both Type 1 and Type 2 recalibrated predictions.

``` r
timi2_model |>
  MiceExtVal::get_calibration_plot_data_prop(
    data = gusto_imp,
    n_groups = 10,
    type = "predictions_recal_type_1"
  ) |>
  MiceExtVal::get_calibration_plot() |>
  clip_axis_plot(limit = 0.35)

timi2_model |>

  ) |>
  MiceExtVal::get_calibration_plot() |>
  clip_axis_plot(limit = 0.35)
```

\(b\) Type 2 recalibration

Figure 2: Calibration plot of recalibration predictions

Even though the AUC does not change with the model recalibration the
Brier score does change. The predictions should be more accurate to the
observed risk after this recalibrations and therefore we should obtain
better Brier scores.

``` r
timi2_model <- timi2_model |>
  MiceExtVal::calculate_brier_score(
    data = gusto_imp, type = "predictions_recal_type_1", n_boot = 100
  ) |>
  MiceExtVal::calculate_brier_score(
    data = gusto_imp, type = "predictions_recal_type_2", n_boot = 100
  )

brier_score_type_1_res <- sprintf(
  "%.3f (95%% CI %.3f, %.3f)",
  timi2_model$brier_score_type_1["Estimate"],
  timi2_model$brier_score_type_1["95% CI L"],
  timi2_model$brier_score_type_1["95% CI U"]
)

brier_score_type_2_res <- sprintf(
  "%.3f (95%% CI %.3f, %.3f)",
  timi2_model$brier_score_type_2["Estimate"],
  timi2_model$brier_score_type_2["95% CI L"],
  timi2_model$brier_score_type_2["95% CI U"]
)
```

The model obtains a Brier score of 0.051 (95% CI 0.044, 0.058) for the
type 1 recalibration and 0.052 (95% CI 0.045, 0.060) for the type 2
recalibration technique. The results are pretty similar to the original
model predictions Brier score 0.052 (95% CI 0.045, 0.059). This results
are aligned to the good calibration of the original model predictions.

## Comparing models

External validation is often performed not only to assess the
performance of a single model, but also to compare multiple models
within the same external cohort. This comparison can help determine
which model performs best overall or within specific subgroups of
interest.

In the previous sections, we demonstrated how to externally validate a
single model using the MiceExtVal package. However, the package also
includes functionality to facilitate comparisons between models, whether
they differ in structure or are applied to different subgroups.

As an example, in this section we stratify the validation of the TIMI-II
model by gender, comparing its performance separately for men and women
patients. To do this, we need to define two distinct model objects—one
for men and one for women. Although both models share the same formula,
they must be created separately to allow storage and comparison of their
respective results.

``` r
timi2_model_men <- MiceExtVal::mv_model_logreg(
  formula = day30 ~ 1.79 * sho + 0.99 * a65 + 0.92 * hig + 0.74 * dia +
    0.69 * hyp + 0.59 * hrt + 0.53 * ttr + 0.47 * sex - 4.47
)
timi2_model_women <- MiceExtVal::mv_model_logreg(
  formula = day30 ~ 1.79 * sho + 0.99 * a65 + 0.92 * hig + 0.74 * dia +
    0.69 * hyp + 0.59 * hrt + 0.53 * ttr + 0.47 * sex - 4.47
)
```

We also need to stratify the cohort by sex in order to use this
subcohorts as parameters for the prediction calculations.

``` r
gusto_imp_men <- gusto_imp |> dplyr::filter(sex == 0)
gusto_imp_women <- gusto_imp |> dplyr::filter(sex == 1)
```

With the stratified cohorts and models defined, we can now calculate the
performance results for each group. It is important to note that each
model is evaluated using the corresponding subcohort. Specifically, the
model `timi2_model_men` will only store and evaluate results from the
`gusto_imp_men` subcohort, which includes only men patients. Similarly,
the model for women will evaluate only the data from the
`gusto_imp_women` subcohort. This ensures that the models are validated
on the appropriate subset of the cohort, allowing for a fair comparison
of performance between the genders.

``` r
timi2_model_men <- timi2_model_men |>
  MiceExtVal::calculate_predictions(gusto_imp_men) |>
  MiceExtVal::calculate_predictions_recalibrated_type_1(gusto_imp_men) |>

### Calibration Comparison: Stratified Calibration Plots

Once the results from both stratified models are stored, we can begin
comparing the model performances. A useful starting point is to compare
the calibration plots for the different subgroups. Similar to individual
calibration plots, we have two functions depending on how we want to
estimate the observed risks:

- [`MiceExtVal::get_stratified_calibration_plot_prop()`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/get_stratified_calibration_plot_prop.md)
  for estimating observed risks using outcome proportions.
- [`MiceExtVal::get_stratified_calibration_plot_surv()`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/get_stratified_calibration_plot_surv.md)
  for estimating risks using a Kaplan–Meier approach (typically for
  survival data).

For our case, since we are working with a binary outcome and stratifying
by sex, we only need to use
[`MiceExtVal::get_stratified_calibration_plot_prop()`](https://metodologianavarrabiomed.github.io/mice-ext-val/reference/get_stratified_calibration_plot_prop.md).

To generate the stratified calibration plot, you’ll need to pass several
arguments to the function:

- The external validation data (e.g., `gusto_imp`)
- The number of groups
- The type of prediction (either recalibrated or original predictions)
- A list of models to compare (in this case, `timi2_model_men` and
  `timi2_model_women`).

This will allow the function to overlay calibration plots for both
models on the same figure, facilitating direct comparison.

``` r
#|
MiceExtVal::get_stratified_calibration_plot_prop(
  data = gusto_imp,
  n_groups = 10,
  type = "predictions_aggregated",
  Men = timi2_model_men,
  Women = timi2_model_women
) |>
  clip_axis_plot(limit = 0.45)
MiceExtVal::get_stratified_calibration_plot_prop(
  data = gusto_imp,
  n_groups = 10,
  type = "predictions_recal_type_1",
  Men = timi2_model_men,
  Women = timi2_model_women
) |>
  clip_axis_plot(limit = 0.45)
MiceExtVal::get_stratified_calibration_plot_prop(
  data = gusto_imp,
  n_groups = 10,
  type = "predictions_recal_type_2",
  Men = timi2_model_men,
  Women = timi2_model_women
) |>
  clip_axis_plot(limit = 0.45)
```

Note that we pass the entire imputed dataset (`gusto_imp`) as an
argument, even though each model only stores the results for its
respective subcohort (men or women). This is necessary because the
function needs access to the full dataset in order to correctly extract
and process the relevant subcohort for each model. The function then
uses the subcohort specified for each model (e.g., `gusto_imp_men` for
men) to calculate the appropriate calibration data and generate the
corresponding calibration plots.

By passing the complete dataset, the function ensures that the
stratified calibration plots are generated correctly, comparing the
models’ calibration in the context of the full cohort’s distribution of
characteristics.

### Discrimination Comparison: Forestplot

The `MiceExtVal` package also includes functionality for generating a
forest plot to compare the discrimination abilities of different models.
In this example, we will visualize the AUC (Area Under the Curve), but
the package also allows for the comparison of the Harrell C-Index in
survival outcomes.

The forest plot generation process is split into two steps:

1.  Data preparation: The first step generates the data that will be
    used in the forest plot.
2.  Forest plot creation: The second step generates the actual plot from
    the prepared data.

To compare different models, we can stratify the results by binding data
from different subgroups (e.g., men and women patients). Models that
share the same name across subgroups will be merged in the final forest
plot, making it easy to compare the performance of the same model in
different groups.

In the following example, we generate two separate strata for the same
model, `TIMI-II`, one for men and one for women, and then we pass these
strata to the forest plot function.

``` r
dplyr::bind_rows(
  MiceExtVal::get_forestplot_data(strat = "Men", type = "auc", `TIMI-II` = timi2_model_men),
  MiceExtVal::get_forestplot_data(strat = "Women", type = "auc", `TIMI-II` = timi2_model_women)
) |>
  MiceExtVal::get_forestplot(center = 0.75)
```

In the following example, we generate a single strat, labeled `Overall`,
that combines the data from both models, one for men and one for women.
This allows us to compare the performance of the two stratified models
in a single forest plot.

Note that we have removed the legend from the plot, as we only have one
strat. Since the legend would be redundant in this case, we have opted
to exclude it. It’s worth noting that, as with any other `ggplot2` plot,
the forest plot can be further customized. You can modify it in any way,
such as by reintroducing the legend, adjusting colors, or tweaking other
visual elements to fit your needs.

``` r
MiceExtVal::get_forestplot_data(
  strat = "Overall", type = "auc",
  `TIMI-II Men` = timi2_model_men, `TIMI-II Women` = timi2_model_women
) |>
  MiceExtVal::get_forestplot(center = 0.75, digits = 2)
```

Finally, both concepts can be combined to generate a forest plot that
compares multiple models across multiple strata. The following example
demonstrates how to compare the general model with its stratified
validation, allowing a side-by-side comparison of model performance
across different subgroups and the overall cohort.

``` r
dplyr::bind_rows(
  MiceExtVal::get_forestplot_data(
    strat = "Overall", type = "auc",
    `TIMI-II` = timi2_model
  ),
  MiceExtVal::get_forestplot_data(
    strat = "Men", type = "auc", `TIMI-II strat` = timi2_model_men
  ),
  MiceExtVal::get_forestplot_data(
    strat = "Women", type = "auc", `TIMI-II strat` = timi2_model_women
  ),
) |>

#### Brier Score Comparison: Forestplot

The forestplot functions also allow us to generate the data from the
Brier score results. The next code snippet generates a forestplot that
compares the different Brier score in each model.

``` r
data <- dplyr::bind_rows(
  MiceExtVal::get_forestplot_data(
    strat = "Original", type = "brier_score",
    Men = timi2_model_men, Women = timi2_model_women
  ),
  MiceExtVal::get_forestplot_data(
    strat = "Type 1 recalibration", type = "brier_score_type_1",
    Men = timi2_model_men, Women = timi2_model_women
  ),
  MiceExtVal::get_forestplot_data(
    strat = "Type 2 recalibration", type = "brier_score_type_2",
    Men = timi2_model_men, Women = timi2_model_women
  ),
)

  MiceExtVal::get_forestplot(
    center = mean(data[["estimate"]]),
    digit = 2,
    axis.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(size = 25)
  )
```
